This is the repository containing the code used for the LLM assignment by Lotte Michels for the Core Topics of Artificial Intelligence course.
I made sure to also include the code output in the uploaded notebook.

Note: the code was written and executed via Kaggle. The data used for fine-tuning the LLM was also stored on Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lottemi/dialog-with-term. 

For running the notebook, this data folder should be accessed. 

Moreover, the code connects to the Hugging Face API and the Weights and Biases API using personal log-in codes (using Kaggle's 'secrets' feature).
